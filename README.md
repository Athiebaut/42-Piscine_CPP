C++ Modules

The C++ Modules are a series of progressive projects designed to introduce and solidify the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming using C++.
They serve as a transition from procedural C programming to a more abstract, structured, and scalable programming paradigm.

Throughout these modules, students progressively explore core OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and code reuse, while learning how to design clean and maintainable class hierarchies. Modules place strong emphasis on understanding how objects interact, how responsibilities are distributed, and how software architecture evolves as complexity grows.

All projects are implemented under the C++98 standard, intentionally restricting access to modern C++ features. This constraint encourages a deeper understanding of fundamental language mechanics, explicit resource management, and manual control over object lifecycles, rather than relying on newer abstractions or syntactic shortcuts.

The modules also introduce key C++ concepts such as copy semantics, operator overloading, templates, exceptions, and later the Standard Template Library (STL). Rather than focusing on isolated exercises, the projects promote long-term reasoning about software design, robustness, and correctness.
